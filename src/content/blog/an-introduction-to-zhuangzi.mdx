## An Introduction to Zhuangzi

There was once a man who dreamt he was a butterfly. When he awoke, he wondered if he was a man who had awoken from a dream or a butterfly still dreaming that it was a man.

This is perhaps the most famous parable from [Zhuangzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)) (莊子), a foundational text of Daoist philosophy.

This article is the first in a series exploring *Zhuangzi* using the celebrated modern scholarly work by Chen Guying, Zhuangzi: Modern Annotations and Translation ([陳鼓應, 莊子今注今譯](https://www.chunghwabook.com.hk/book/detail/id/1245315015285780481)).

## Background

The [Warring States period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period) of China (c. 475–221 BC) was an era of incessant warfare and political fragmentation. Following the collapse of the [Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty) dynasty's central authority, seven major states vied for supremacy over an erstwhile unified realm. This prolonged chaos brought immense suffering: fields abandoned, populations displaced, and entire cities razed. A fundamental question haunted this age: *How can order be restored and suffering ended?*

Paradoxically, the age's devastating disorder provided fertile ground for philosophy, yielding a generation of thinkers with rival visions for ending suffering. These intellectuals traveled from court to court seeking patronage from rulers for support and the opportunity to implement their ideas. Collectively, these itinerant philosophers came to be known as the ["Hundred Schools of Thought"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Schools_of_Thought)[^hundred], and many of its leading figures bore the honorific title "*zi*" (子, "Master")— denoting respect for their wisdom and their role as teachers of a particular way or doctrine.

The problems these intellectuals grappled with were both practical and profound: How should society be organized? What obligations do individuals owe each other and the state? What is the source of legitimate authority? How can violence be curtailed and prosperity restored? Different schools proposed radically different answers.

The **Confucianists** (儒家), following Confucius (*Kongzi*, 孔子) and later Mencius (*Mengzi*, 孟子), believed the crisis stemmed from a decay of traditional social relationships, rituals, and moral cultivation. They advocated restoring order through benevolence (*ren*, 仁), ritual propriety[^zr] (*li*, 禮), and the cultivation of virtue in rulers and subjects alike. Society should be structured around *hierarchical but reciprocal relationships*— ruler-minister, father-son, husband-wife— each bound by mutual obligations[^oblig]. The ideal ruler was a moral paragon whose virtue would inspire his subject’s goodness.

The **Mohists** (墨家), followers of Mozi (墨子), pushed a more utilitarian vision. They condemned the Confucian emphasis on ritual and hierarchy as wasteful and unequal, promoting "impartial care" (*jian ai*, 兼愛)— universal love without distinctions of kinship or status— and argued that society should be meritocratic and utilitarian. Aggressive warfare should be condemned (*fei gong*, 非攻), resources should not be wasted on elaborate rituals or music, and every action should be judged by the benefits it confers the people.

The **Legalists** (法家), represented by thinkers like Han Feizi (韓非子) and the policies of the state of Qin, took the darkest view of human nature. They argued that people respond only to rewards and punishments, not moral suasion. Order could be achieved only through clearly codified laws (*fa*, 法), administrative methods (*shu*, 術), and the concentration of power in the ruler's hands (*shi*, 勢). The ruler should be Machiavellian, controlling his subjects through draconian laws and surveillance, treating ministers and commoners alike as potential threats.

Each of these schools, despite their differences, shared a common orientation: they were primarily concerned with **governance, social order, and the proper structuring of human relationships**. Their ultimate goal was to end the chaos by reforming how people lived together in society.

**Zhuangzi** (莊子, "Master Zhuang"), by contrast, offered something radically different. Zhuang Zhou (莊周) lived around the late 4th century BC, roughly contemporary with Mencius. While other intellectuals clamored for the attention of rulers and competed to implement their political programs, Zhuangzi questioned the entire enterprise. He saw the pursuit of power, status, legacy, and even moral self-cultivation as artificial constructs and shackles. The scramble for patronage, the urgency to "fix" society, the belief that human cleverness could solve fundamental problems— all of this, he opined, was part of the disease, not the cure.

Instead of governance and social restructuring, Zhuangzi's focus was on **individual freedom and spiritual liberation**. He advocated withdrawal from the psychological imprisonment of human ambition, judgment, and the tyranny of conventional values. Rather than imposing order on the world, one should align oneself with the Path (*dao*, 道)— the spontaneous, ever-flowing pattern of nature that transcends human categorization. True freedom comes not from reforming society or oneself but from liberating one's own consciousness, learning to be unencumbered by life’s concerns.

This made Zhuangzi's Daoism fundamentally distinct from the more politically engaged Daoist text, the *Daodejing*, which still offered advice to rulers about governing through non-interference (*wu wei*, 無為). Zhuangzi went further: he showed little interest in advising rulers and even mocked those who sought political power. In one famous story, when offered a high ministerial position, Zhuangzi compared himself to a sacred turtle— would it prefer to be dead and venerated, its shell used in rituals, or alive and dragging its tail in the mud? He chose the mud.

The text that bears his name, *Zhuangzi*, is a collection of parables, allegories, and philosophical arguments. It is traditionally divided into three sections: the Inner Chapters (Chapters 1–7), Outer Chapters (Chapters 8–22), and Miscellaneous Chapters (Chapters 23–33). Scholars generally agree that the seven Inner Chapters represent the core teachings of Zhuangzi himself, while the later chapters reflect the work of his disciples and later Daoist thinkers, though they still contain valuable elaborations on his philosophy.

## A Note on the Choice of Text and Ancient Chinese

Translating a 2,400-year-old text is not straightforward. Classical Chinese is a terse and ambiguous language. Characters can have multiple meanings, grammar is often contextual rather than explicit, and semantics frequently depend on cultural and literary references and allusions that have been lost over millennia.

Compounding these difficulties, the manuscripts themselves present substantial challenges. Ancient Chinese texts were written without punctuation, spacing, or paragraph breaks— an unbroken stream of characters that must be carefully parsed by the reader. Where one chooses to divide sentences can dramatically alter meaning and scholars often disagree about the proper segmentation of passages. Furthermore, the texts have been transmitted through countless generations of hand-copying, a process that inevitably introduced transcription errors, variant readings, and occasional omissions. A single miscopied character can send interpretation in entirely different directions.

However, there is reason for optimism. As archaeological excavations continue to unearth older manuscripts, scholars gain access to versions of Zhuangzi that predate the received tradition by centuries. Each new discovery refines our understanding, helps us recover readings that were corrupted in later transmission, resolve longstanding interpretive puzzles, and bring us closer to what Zhuangzi and his disciples originally wrote.

For this reason, our exploration will rely on Chen Guying's Zhuangzi: Modern Annotations and Translation (陳鼓應, 莊子今注今譯). This work is highly regarded in the Chinese-speaking world for masterfully incorporating recent archaeological finds, modern interpretation, and elegant translations.

By using this text as our foundation, we can engage with Zhuangzi's thought with a high degree of confidence and clarity, ensuring fidelity to the original text, and that our interpretation is grounded in sound scholarship.

## Why Read Zhuangzi in the 21st Century?

In a world fixated on productivity, achievement, and "hustle culture," Zhuangzi's emphasis on *wu wei* is a call to sanity, teaching us to distinguish between effective, harmonious action and stressful, pointless striving. It is a philosophy that can help us achieve our ends without being consumed by ambition, social expectations, or simply swept around thoughtlessly by the torrents of life.

This introduction has only scratched the surface. In our next post, we will delve into the magnificent opening chapter of the Zhuangzi, "Free and Easy Wandering" (*xiaoyao you*, 逍遙遊). We will meet the giant bird who blots out the sky and the tiny quail who laughs at him, and in doing so, we will begin our true journey into one of the world's most liberating philosophies.

[^zr]: In particular, a return to rituals of the Zhou dynasty.
[^hundred]: Note that while “hundred” is an exaggeration, there are many other schools not covered in this brief introduction.
[^oblig]:  These obligations tend to favour the first in each pair.
