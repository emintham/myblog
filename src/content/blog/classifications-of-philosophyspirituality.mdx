There are two "layers" to a human-- the physical and the meta-physical. On the physical layer, we determine our actions and behaviour. On the metaphysical, our thoughts and belief about "reality" or what lies beyond. We decide our ethics, morals, values in the physical world-- how we treat others, what constitutes moral action, what we prioritize in our worldly pursuits.

There are a few possibilities on the metaphysical layer: what we see is all there is, theistic view, non-theistic non-dual apophatic.

## Class 1: Humanistic/Practical

- not concerned with God or "ultimate reality"
- suffering is a practical human problem with human solutions

### Theravada Buddhism

Idea: Four Noble Truths
Method: Noble Eightfold Path

### Stoicism

Idea: World ruled by *logos* (rationality). We can only control ourselves. Virtue is the only good.
Method: Logic, discipline, focus on what you can control.

### Confucianism

Idea: Good life through self-cultivation and correct relationships
Method: Education, ritual, and practice of virtues.

### Yangmingism

Idea: Innate moral compass is all you need. There is no self to seek outside truth.
Method: Know thyself and do as your inner compass dictates. Meditate and clear selfish desires to achieve innate knowing.

## Class 2: Theistic

- There is one or more God(s). The point is to form the right relationship.

### Abrahamic Religions

Idea: There is only one transcendental God that created the universe. People are separate beings.
Method: Faith, prayer, repentance, obedience. Goal is to enter a proper relationship with God (heaven).

### Bhakti Hinduism

Idea: God is a personal divine being to be loved.
Method: Devotion, chanting, and service. Goal is to love God and reside in their presence.

## Class 3: Non-dual, apophatic

- self is an illusion
- reality is an indivisible, indescribable whole

### Madhyamaka Buddhism

Idea: Reality is empty. All phenomena is "dependently arisen" and have no independent existence.
Method: Deconstruction until pure, non-conceptual awareness remains.

### Daoism

Idea: Reality is Dao. It is the process of everything.
Method: Stop "trying" and align with the flow. Deconstruction via paradox.

### Advaita Vedanta (Hinduism)

Idea: individual soul (Atman) is the ultimate reality (Brahman). Separation is an illusion (Maya).
Method: Use query (who am I?) to negate all false identifications until only the pure Atman remains

### Zen

Idea: ordinary, everyday mind is the Buddha. Nothing to seek or attain, just need to "wake up".
Method: Zazen, koans, short-circuiting by master. Sudden realization of emptiness.

### Sufism (Wahdat al-wujud)

Idea: No true existence except God. All "creation" is a reflection of God, self is an illusion.
Method: Dhikr, meditation, poetry, *fana-fillah*. Goal is to experience divine directly.
