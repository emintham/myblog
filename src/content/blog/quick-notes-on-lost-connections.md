In this [book](https://amzn.to/3T5bDXf), Hari debunks the popular view of a broken brain causing depression.
i.e. the serotonin theory of depression. Hari posits that the general scientific
consensus does not agree with this theory and that this theory is propagated by
big pharmaceutical companies as an effort to market its lucrative antidepressants.
Hari further asserts that:

1. the scientific literature surrounding the efficacy of such drugs over
non-chemical intervention has been cherry picked,
2. the intended effects of such drugs are short-lived, and
3. there are more effective intervention that do not involve drugs.

Hari proposes that depression is caused by a trifecta of long term stressors,
adverse events, and a lack of positive stabilizers. These three aspects are then
further organized into 9 possible causes of depression and methods to overcome
them are suggested.

My personal experience with depressions agrees with the general thesis of the
book that depression seems over-medicated in general and that the efficacy of
antidepressants are a slightly suspect. However, the approaches suggested are a
tad optimistic and slightly unrealistic for most people to fully apply in this
modern world. If one were to distill actionable steps from this, it would be to

1. sleep more
2. get out in nature
3. be kind
4. connect with people
5. meditate
6. quit your demeaning job
7. find purpose in your life
8. advocate for universal basic income

Not that any of this is untrue or bad advice, just likely not practical for a
lot of people who are struggling just to get by.
