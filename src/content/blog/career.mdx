There is another subtle arena of comparison: the urge to correct others. You have a tendency for accuracy— and that’s great! Much of people’s daily conversations are ambiguous and we should strive for accuracy whenever we can. However, people misspeak. You can politely and gently point them to the right information in private. Alternatively, they could be intentionally trying to
spread misinformation or sway a narrative; in this case, you'll probably want
to weigh the impact of this misinformation on the audience against offending
this person. Is it worth the risk to you (and the people you care about) [^selfish] to point this out? With your ADHD, I understand far too well your impulse to correct it for I have had similar social faux pas in my youth. The correction springs to mind, and the impulse to voice it can be immediate, often bypassing any conscious consideration. I’ve had many sleepless nights, regretting these past mindless mistakes. Again, mindfulness will help here. Not all idioms and
sayings are wise in every situation but in these cases, "praise in public,
criticize in private", and in the latter, do so sparingly. I share here
with you an interesting excerpt from the excellent [Autobiography of Benjamin
Franklin](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20203/20203-h/20203-h.htm) [^5] that illustrates this point. Franklin’s transformation, from a
"positive arguer" to a "humble inquirer" is a testament to the strength found
in intellectual modesty and the art of gentle persuasiveness [^6].

> (Regarding the Socratic method) I found this method safest for myself and very embarrassing to those against whom I used it; therefore I took a delight in it, practis'd it continually, and grew very artful and expert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into concessions, the consequences of which they did not foresee, entangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate themselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my cause always deserved. I continu'd this method some few years, but gradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced anything that may possibly be disputed, the words certainly, undoubtedly, or any others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me, or I should think it so or so, for such and such reasons; or I imagine it to be so; or it is so, if I am not mistaken. This habit, I believe, has been of great advantage to me when I have had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and persuade men into measures that I have been from time to time engaged in promoting; and, as the chief ends of conversation are to inform or to be informed, to please or to persuade, I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat everyone of those purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure. For, if you would inform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention. If you wish information and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet at the same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in your present opinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, will probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error. And by such a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in pleasing your hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire. 

As with most things, it would be remiss of me if I did not caution you against
going to the extreme. It is beneficial and advantageous in many cases to market
and promote yourself. Care and judgement must be taken to not overdo it or
diminish the contributions of others. In life, only you can be your best
advocate. If you create the most innovative invention in the world but no one
knows about it, it is not useful to anyone [^7]. Practically speaking, talking
about your accomplishments or creations in a matter-of-fact way or framing it
as a net benefit to others is more palatable. You can also very gently remind
others of how you helped them by framing it as a follow-up question. "Hey,
just wanted to check in to see how you were doing with X? Did it help you? Did
you have any questions or concerns about it?". People can and do forget the
help they've received, not usually from malice, but because their own concerns
and priorities are naturally foremost in their minds. While it can be magnanimous to simply treat help rendered as charity, it is not the wisest course of action when working in a group. Your energy and resources are limited; being able to leverage those favours and have it translate to tangible benefits will likely benefit everyone in the long run [^8]. Give freely, but make sure they remember— and without being a jerk about it.

[^selfish]: Sometimes, the right answer is to do what you believe in strongly
        and not care too much about what your loved ones think. Far too often,
        we make decisions based on what we *think* our loved ones want
        instead of what they actually want or what *we* want. Identifying your
        core principles and convictions will help you make the choice that
        you can live with, even if it may cause the ire of your loved ones.
[^3]: The book [Supersurvivors](https://amzn.to/3ZGrDme) by Lee Kravetz offers stories of people who have experienced this and thrived. If this resonates with you, I suggest availing yourself of this resource.
[^5]: A book I wholeheartedly recommend.
[^6]: You may perhaps be interested in reminding yourself of Aesop's fable of the North Wind and the Sun.
[^7]: Utilitarianism is, of course, a value you may or not may ascribe to but we will leave that aside for the moment.

[^cgt]: There is a similar quote from《菜根谭》that is a bit more bombastic “操存要有真宰，无真宰则遇事便倒，何以植顶天立地之砥柱！应用要有圆机，无圆机则触物有碍，何以成旋乾转坤之经纶！”.
[^therapy]: Therapy is widely regarded as the most recommended way of shedding mental and behavioural habits in modern times. While therapy (with the right therapist) excels at unearthing deeply rooted mental shortcuts, early adoption of mindfulness, self-awareness, and meditation can help you identify and uproot these habits before they take hold. Moreover, they do not require an external party to help you and require no lengthy search process for the right fit.
