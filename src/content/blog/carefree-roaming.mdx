Carefree Roaming (*Xiaoyao you*, 逍遙遊) is the first essay of the Inner Chapters and covers the themes of artificiality of categorization and differentiation, the emptiness of name and status, the questionable nature of utility, and, most importantly, highlights the ideal mental state of a sage. The essay can roughly be split into three sections and we will be covering the first of these sections in this post.

In reading Zhuangzi, it behooves us to first discuss the concept of *xiaoyao* as it represents the ideal state of mind in Zhuangzi’s philosophy. I have translated this as “carefree” here. It is the absence of worries, of a type of mental freedom, of an easiness of moving with the flow. Other translators have rendered it differently, [Burton](https://amzn.to/47kXqfS) translates this as “Free and Easy” while Ziporyn translates the entire title as “Wandering Far and Unfettered”. The latter is closer semantically but unfortunately overlaps with the commonly used Buddhist concept of fetters. The concepts of liberation in both are indeed similar: to free oneself from the mental constraints of convention, habit, social expectations. The parts where they differ is perhaps what each identifies as the root cause. In Buddhism, this is suffering/attachment with the prescription to detach. In Zhuangzi, it is the misalignment with nature, the fight against the current of the natural flow.

《逍遙遊》篇，主旨是說一個人當透破功名利祿、權勢尊位的束縛，而使精神活動臻於優遊自在、無掛無礙的境地。

本篇可分三章，首章起筆描繪一個廣大無窮的世界；次寫「小知不及大知」，點出「小大之辯」；接著寫無功、無名及破除自我中心，而與天地精神往來。第二章借「讓天下」寫去名去功，借「肩吾問連叔」一段寫至人無己的精神境界。篇末借惠施與莊子的對話，說到用大與「無用之用」的意義。

“北冥有魚，其名為鯤。鯤之大，不知其幾千里也。化而為鳥，其名為鵬。鵬之背，不知其幾千里也；怒而飛，其翼若垂天之雲 。是鳥也，海運則將徙於南冥。南冥者，天池也。”

### Translation

In the northern sea dwelt a fish named “Kun”, vast beyond measure. It transformed into a bird named “Peng”. When Peng beat its wings and took flight, they stretched across the sky like clouds at heaven's edge. Riding the sea winds, this great bird made its journey to the southern sea— that celestial pool.

### Notes

While this passage reads like pure mythology, it encapsulates some of Zhuangzi’s central ideas.

First, Zhuangzi specifically “names” the beast in the story twice. Once, as “Kun”— an archaic term for tiny fish and, again, as “Peng” when it transforms into a bird. This deliberate choice highlights the arbitrariness and limitations of names and categories. Are the fish and the bird truly different beings, or is this distinction merely a product of our limited perspective? Zhuangzi suggests that our linguistic categories and social classifications ("fish" versus "bird," "small" versus "large," "lowly" versus "magnificent") impose artificial boundaries on a reality that is fundamentally fluid and interconnected.

Secondly, the northern sea represents a primordial, undifferentiated space— perhaps the Dao itself. Only by dwelling in alignment with the Dao can the seemingly insignificant realize its boundless potential and transform into something magnificent [^sdq].

Thirdly, the beast rides the “winds” towards a destination in the south that is specifically described as “celestial” or “natural”. The word 天 conflates these meanings where the cosmic order and natural order are one. Furthermore, the wind imagery, which appears throughout Daoist texts, embodies the principle of *wu wei* (無為) non-forcing action, or achieving great things not through striving but through alignment with the natural flow of things.

Taken together, these elements paint a vision of limitless potential available to those who transcend mental constraints— the fixed identities, rigid categories, and conventional expectations and ambitions that bind us. By acting in alignment with the natural currents of existence rather than against them, one can truly be liberated.

“《齊諧》者，志怪者也。《諧》之言曰：「鵬之徙於南冥也，水擊三千里，搏扶搖而上者九萬裡。去以六月息者也。」野馬也，塵埃也，生物之以息相吹也。天之蒼蒼，其正色邪？其遠而無所至極邪？其視下也，亦若是則已矣。”

“且夫水之積也不厚，則其負大舟也無力。覆杯水於坳堂之上 ，則芥為之舟；置杯焉則膠 ，水淺而舟大也。風之積也不厚，則其負大翼也無力。故九萬裡，則風斯在下矣，而後乃今培風 ；背負靑天而莫之夭閼者，而後乃今將圖南。”

“蜩與學鳩笑之曰：「我決起而飛 ，搶楡枋 ，時則不至而控於地而已矣，奚以之九萬裡而南為 ？」適莽蒼 者，三飡而反 ，腹猶果然；適百里者，宿舂糧；適千里者，三月聚糧。之二蟲又何知！”

“小知不及大知，小年不及大年。奚以知其然也？朝菌不知晦朔，蟪蛄不知春秋 ，此小年也。楚之南有冥靈 者，以五百歲為春，五百歲為秋；上古有大椿者，以八千歲為春，八千歲為秋，此大年也 。而彭祖乃今以久特聞，眾人匹之，不亦悲乎！”

“湯之問棘也是已：
湯問棘曰：「上下四方有極乎？」
棘曰：「無極之外，復無極也。窮髪之北有冥海者，天池也。有魚焉，其廣數千里，未有知其修 者，其名為鯤。有鳥焉，其名為鵬，背若太山 ，翼若垂天之雲，搏扶搖羊角 而上者九萬裡，絕雲氣，負靑天，然後圖南，〔且適南冥也〕 。斥鴳 笑之曰：‘彼且奚適也？我騰躍而上，不過數仭 而下，翱翔蓬蒿之間，此亦飛之至也。而彼且奚適也？’」此小大之辯也 。”

“故夫知效一官，行比 一鄕，德合一君而徵一國 者，其自視也亦若此矣 。而宋榮子 猶然 笑之。且舉世而譽之而不加勸，舉世而非之而不加沮，定乎內外之分，辯乎榮辱之境，斯已矣。彼其於世未數數然 也。雖然，猶有未樹也。夫列子御風而行，泠然善也，旬有五日而後反 。彼於致福者，未數數然也。此雖免乎行，猶有所待 者也。”

“若夫乘天地之正 ，而御六氣之辯 ，以遊無窮者，彼且惡乎待哉 ！故曰，至人無己 ，神人無功，聖人無名。”
