Carefree Roaming (*xiaoyao you*, 逍遙遊) is the first essay of Zhuangzi’s Inner Chapters and form the main thesis of these chapters. It covers the artificiality of differentiation, the emptiness of name and status, the questionable nature of utility, and, most importantly, describes the ideal consciousness of a sage. The essay can roughly be split into three sections and we will be covering the first of these in this post.

In reading Zhuangzi, it behooves us to first discuss the concept of *xiaoyao* as it represents the ideal state of mind in Zhuangzi’s philosophy. I have translated this as “carefree” here. It is more than the absence of worries, rather, it is a type of mental/spiritual freedom, an easiness of moving with the flow. Other translators have rendered it differently, [Burton](https://amzn.to/47kXqfS), for example, translates this as “Free and Easy” while Ziporyn translates the entire title as “Wandering Far and Unfettered”. The latter is closer semantically but also overlaps with the Buddhist concept of fetters.

Liberation in both traditions are indeed similar: to free oneself from the mental constraints of convention, habit, and social expectations. The parts where they differ is in what each identifies as the root cause. In Buddhism, this is suffering arising from attachment with the prescription being compassion and detachment. In Zhuangzi, it is the misalignment with nature, the fight against the current of the natural flow. To be free then, one must flow naturally.

## Main Text

北冥有魚，其名為鯤。鯤之大，不知其幾千里也。化而為鳥，其名為鵬。鵬之背，不知其幾千里也；怒而飛，其翼若垂天之雲 。是鳥也，海運則將徙於南冥。南冥者，天池也。

《齊諧》者，志怪者也。《諧》之言曰：「鵬之徙於南冥也，水擊三千里，搏扶搖而上者九萬裡。去以六月息者也。」野馬也，塵埃也，生物之以息相吹也。天之蒼蒼，其正色邪？其遠而無所至極邪？其視下也，亦若是則已矣。

且夫水之積也不厚，則其負大舟也無力。覆杯水於坳堂之上 ，則芥為之舟；置杯焉則膠 ，水淺而舟大也。風之積也不厚，則其負大翼也無力。故九萬裡，則風斯在下矣，而後乃今培風 ；背負靑天而莫之夭閼者，而後乃今將圖南。

### Translation

In the northern sea dwelt a fish named “Kun”[^kun], vast beyond measure. It transformed into a bird named “Peng”. When Peng beat its wings and took flight, they stretched across the sky like clouds at heaven's edge. Riding the sea winds, this great bird made its journey to the southern sea— that celestial pool.

The book of marvels, *Qi Xie*[^qx], records, “as Peng migrates south, the waves rise as high as three thousand *li* [^li]; it rides the cyclone up ninety thousand *li*, on the winds of the sixth month. The air, the dust, and living things are all moved by the winds. Is blue the true colour of the sky? Or is it because it is far and without an edge? When it looks down, perhaps the view is the same.

Shallow waters cannot float a large boat. Water from a cup, poured into a nook  can float dried grass. If you place the cup on the water, however, the cup gets stuck. This is because the water is shallow and the boat is large. If the winds are not strong enough, it cannot lift large wings. Thus, to rise ninety-thousand *li*, the winds must lift Peng from below so that it may carry the skies without obstacles as it makes its southern journey.

### Notes

Zhuangzi invites us to think about several questions in this short passage.

*The Essence of things*: The label/name we identify with or ascribe to things (fish vs bird) limit our understanding and potential. Are the properties we observe of certain things — the blueness of the sky, for example — intrinsic to the entity of a reflection of other extrinsic factors?

*Alignment with the Dao*: The migration and the ascent of Peng is attributed directly to the “winds”. Specific external conditions need to be satisfied and be in alignment with nature in order for certain actions to be possible. Peng’s magnificent flight is not due to any intrinsic quality or ability but effortless coordination with natural forces.

While this passage reads like pure mythology, it encapsulates some of Zhuangzi’s central ideas.

First, Zhuangzi specifically “names” the beast in the story twice. Once, as “Kun”— an archaic term for a fish egg and, again, as “Peng” when it transforms into a bird. This deliberate choice highlights the arbitrariness and limitations of names and categories. Are the fish and the bird truly different beings, or is this distinction merely a product of our limited perspective? As we will see again in the later paragraphs, Zhuangzi suggests that our linguistic categories and social classifications (“fish” versus “bird”, “small” versus “large”, “lowly” versus “magnificent”) impose artificial boundaries on the essence of things.

Secondly, the northern sea represents a primordial, undifferentiated space— perhaps the Dao itself. Burton and Ziporyn translate it as the Northern darkness and oblivion respectively. Only by dwelling in alignment with the Dao can the seemingly insignificant realize its boundless potential and transform into something magnificent [^sdq].

This reliance or precondition of Dao alignment is reiterated again: the beast rides the “winds” towards a destination in the south that is specifically described as “celestial” or “natural”. The word 天 conflates these meanings where the cosmic order and natural order are one. Furthermore, the wind imagery, which appears throughout Daoist texts, embodies the principle of *wu wei* (無為) non-forcing action, or achieving great things not through striving but through alignment with the natural flow of things.

Taken together, these elements paint a vision of limitless potential available to those who transcend mental constraints— the fixed identities, rigid categories, and conventional expectations and ambitions that bind us. By acting in alignment with the natural currents of existence rather than against them, one can be truly liberated.

The imagery of the wind is pervasive in this short passage. Notice that Peng rides the winds up. Crucially, Zhuangzi never attributes Peng’s ascent to its own power or ability. The bird does not conquer the heights through strength or effort, it simply rides what is already there. What conventional thinking would celebrate as the Peng’s “achievement” (of rising high) is revealed to be less about personal merit than about alignment with natural forces. The sixth month in particular is one of monsoon season, suggesting a wait for the right opportunity.

Zhuangzi reiterates this explicitly, “all things are moved by the wind”— the Dao  permeates all things. Zhuangzi pivots to an epistemological question: is the sky really blue? Is it an intrinsic quality or the effects of an extrinsic force (Dao), or perhaps its relationship to other entities? Reality shifts depending on where one stands. This anticipates a central insight: our categories and judgments reveal more about our limited viewpoint than about the true nature of things — if such a thing is even definable.

Finally, notice the ambiguous *it* in the last paragraph. The subject is not immediately clear. While most translators interpret it to be Peng, I have decided to preserve the ambiguity. Could this also be the sky looking down at Peng or at us? Or the Dao observing all things? By leaving this open, Zhuangzi invites us to shift perspectives and recognize that what seems vast to us might too perceive us as such.

“蜩與學鳩笑之曰：「我決起而飛 ，搶楡枋 ，時則不至而控於地而已矣，奚以之九萬裡而南為 ？」適莽蒼 者，三飡而反 ，腹猶果然；適百里者，宿舂糧；適千里者，三月聚糧。之二蟲又何知！”

“小知不及大知，小年不及大年。奚以知其然也？朝菌不知晦朔，蟪蛄不知春秋 ，此小年也。楚之南有冥靈 者，以五百歲為春，五百歲為秋；上古有大椿者，以八千歲為春，八千歲為秋，此大年也 。而彭祖乃今以久特聞，眾人匹之，不亦悲乎！”

“湯之問棘也是已：
湯問棘曰：「上下四方有極乎？」
棘曰：「無極之外，復無極也。窮髪之北有冥海者，天池也。有魚焉，其廣數千里，未有知其修 者，其名為鯤。有鳥焉，其名為鵬，背若太山 ，翼若垂天之雲，搏扶搖羊角 而上者九萬裡，絕雲氣，負靑天，然後圖南，〔且適南冥也〕 。斥鴳 笑之曰：‘彼且奚適也？我騰躍而上，不過數仭 而下，翱翔蓬蒿之間，此亦飛之至也。而彼且奚適也？’」此小大之辯也 。”

“故夫知效一官，行比 一鄕，德合一君而徵一國 者，其自視也亦若此矣 。而宋榮子 猶然 笑之。且舉世而譽之而不加勸，舉世而非之而不加沮，定乎內外之分，辯乎榮辱之境，斯已矣。彼其於世未數數然 也。雖然，猶有未樹也。夫列子御風而行，泠然善也，旬有五日而後反 。彼於致福者，未數數然也。此雖免乎行，猶有所待 者也。”

“若夫乘天地之正 ，而御六氣之辯 ，以遊無窮者，彼且惡乎待哉 ！故曰，至人無己 ，神人無功，聖人無名。”

[^qx]: There are many interpretations of this. The consensus seems to be that this refers to a book instead of a person. *Qi* in particular could be a surname, one of the seven countries fighting for control, or “equal”. The pertinent point here is that it is a fictional book and Zhuangzi is perhaps using this in a tongue-in-cheek manner as a “reference”.
