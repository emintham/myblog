This marks the beginning of a series of notes and letters to my son, Jay.

Everyone charts their own course in life, some lessons are learnt by osmosis and observation, while
others are learnt with more bumps and scrapes along the way. As I share with
you the ELI5 version in person, I will also take more care to record them here,
perhaps with a little more nuance and references, for you to read when you are
older. Should you need to be reminded of these lessons in the future, they are
here-- just as I hope to still be around for you should you need me.

You don't have to be like me or live up to any of my standards. You are your own
self and I will love you for who you are. The lessons herein are not prescriptions
for how to live your life, but rather reflections of my own experiences and
observations. They reflect the environment and circumstances of my life and the
cards I was dealt. You will have your own cards to play, in a future that is very
different from my past and I hope you play your cards to the best of your ability.
There is no need for you to follow my path, or indeed, anyone's else's path but your own.
You are headstrong and independent-- these are qualities I admire in you, even if they
frustrate me and your mother at times. Life sometimes has a way to humble us and
sand down those rough edges, but I hope you find a way to keep your spirit and
not let the world beat you down.
