This marks the beginning of a series of notes and letters to my son, Jay.

Everyone charts their own course in life; some lessons are learnt by osmosis
and observation, while
others are learnt with more bumps and scrapes along the way. As I share with
you the ELI5[^eli] version in person, I will also take more care to record them here,
with a little more nuance and references, for you to read when you are
older. The lessons are here should you need a reminder, here-- just as I hope
I'm around for you should you need me.

You don't have to be like me or live up to any of my standards. You are your individual
self and I will love you for who you are. The lessons herein are not prescriptions
for how to live your life, but rather reflections of my own experiences and
observations. They reflect the environment and circumstances of my life and the
cards I was dealt. You will have your cards to play, in a future that is very
different from my past and I hope you play your cards to the best of your ability.
There is no need for you to follow my path, or indeed, anyone's else's path but your own.
You are headstrong and independent-- these are qualities I admire in you, even if they
frustrate me and your mother at times. Life sometimes has a way to humble us and
sand down those rough edges, but I hope you find a way to keep your spirit and
not let the world beat you down.

[^eli]: Explain like I'm 5. In case this is no longer a thing in the future, this is a
        common internet phrase used to ask for a simplified explanation of a complex
        topic. It is most often used in online forums and discussions.
