Driven by a desire to learn more about the arcane arts of SEO and a prophecy
exhorting me to establish this ~~blog~~ phylactery as the definitive herald for
my name in Google's search results, I embarked on a quest.

A long, long time ago [^prior], in a galaxy far far away, the first few results were of
my LinkedIn account and some dormant social media accounts that I rarely used or
frequented. The cached results were old and outdated, beguiling hapless searchers
with their misleading guise, sounding a false echo from bygone days. With the help
of my [familiar](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/), we sculpted the [shell](/blog/jay-lesson-0)
of the phylactery on May 12 and launched it. It was met with naught but crickets.

I had no followers, no audience, and no one to share it with.
Moreover, the content of that post was personal and not exactly riveting,
and I did not feel comfortable just scattering wisps of my Horcrux upon the
digital winds. I decided to take a more "organic" approach and just add links to and from the
[template](https://github.com/emintham/blog-template) powering this soul shard [^gh]. Over
the course of the next couple of days, I continued by dusting off those
moth-bitten tomes of social spells and inscribing them with runes of return that led back here.
Pages were also added and rewritten in my burgeoning chronicles as I revised and
improved my ~~writing~~ lore-making. After about 7 days, I was able to get the first post to
rank on the first page of results! A most auspicious sign!

In tandem with this "strategy" [^strategy], I had also read that
making the page fast would help with SEO, so I spent some time with my digital
familiar fixing issues decried by [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) (PSI),
that inscrutable oracle. Given that this phylactery was ~~hosted~~ securely,
stowed in the mighty buttressed towers of Cloudflare, and utilized
[Astro](https://astro.build/)'s cantrips of static generation, the initial score without any
intervention was already decent (80+ on mobile and 90+ on desktop). I layered
further enchantments upon my phylactery, including:

- Preloading fonts.
- Enabling certain cloudflare settings for caching.
- Resizing images and converting to "next-gen" webp format.

The true potency of these enchantments upon my standing in the great Google ledger
is murky, but the oracle always demanded sacrifices before a noble conquest.
While this was happening, I noticed that the search results indicated that I
had neglected to update my ~~favicon~~ sigil [^favicon], which
still bore the mundane mark of its Astro lineage. This oversight was swiftly mended.

Fate, the mercurial mistress, had other plans in store. At roughly the same time
of my true branding of the sigil, my banner was abruptly cast from its rightful place
on the first page! My other action
around the same time was the addition of the [book notes post](/blog/notes-on-writing-to-learn)
which includes an image of the book cover [^self-host]. Despite my scrying, I
couldn't pinpoint whether it was
the sigil change, the addition of the blasphemous image, or something else entirely that caused this delisting.
Could this graven image have triggered the baleful eye of the copyright sentinels?
A perplexing riddle indeed!

Careful reconnaissance of the digital wilds led to a welcome rumour: a possible [turncoat](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)
within Google's ranks! Would they be the key to uncovering the conspiracy behind
this injustice? A series of secret handshakes and esoteric signs [^ownership] later,
they admitted me into their outer ranks and bade me to patience, promising a report
of their investigations. This turn of events
left me anxious to ponder what tidings these findings would portend.

Stay tuned for the next installment of this saga when we enter the lair of the beast
and see what evil machinations are in store for us!

[^strategy]: which doesn't really mean much when you have only a few social accounts and a blog with only a few posts.
[^ownership]: It was a mostly automated process to authorize Google to access
  DNS records on Cloudflare.
[^gh]: Praying, perchance, that House Github would lend its gravitas to my cause.
[^self-host]: self-hosted to avoid hot-linking.
[^prior]: Prior to May 12, 2025.
[^favicon]: The tiny symbol of my phylactery in browser tabs for the non-web developer
  folks reading this.
