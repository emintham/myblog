Driven by a desire to learn more about the arcane arts of SEO and a prophecy
exhorting me to establish this ~~blog~~ phylactery as the definitive herald for
my name in Google's search results, I embarked on a quest.

A long, long time ago [^prior], in a galaxy far, far away, the first few results were of my LinkedIn account and some dormant social media accounts that I rarely used or frequented. The cached results were old and outdated, beguiling hapless searchers with their misleading guise, sounding a false echo from bygone days. With the help of my [familiar](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/), we sculpted the [shell](/blog/jay-lesson-0)
of the phylactery on May 12 and launched it. It was met with naught but crickets.

I had no followers, no audience, and no one to share it with.
Moreover, the content of that post was personal and not exactly riveting,
and I did not feel comfortable scattering wisps of my Horcrux upon the
digital winds. Therefore, I decided to pursue a more "organic" path, first adding links to and from the
[template](https://github.com/emintham/blog-template) powering this soul shard [^gh]. Over
the course of the next couple of days, I continued by dusting off those
moth-bitten tomes of social spells and inscribing them with runes of return that led back here.
Pages were also added and rewritten in my burgeoning chronicles as I revised and
improved my ~~writing~~ lore-making. After about 7 days, I was able to get the first post to
rank on the first page of results! A most auspicious sign!

In tandem with this "strategy" [^strategy], I had also read that
making the page fast would help with SEO, so I spent some time with my digital
familiar fixing issues decried by the inscrutable oracle, known only by the symbol
Ψ [^psi]. Given that this phylactery was ~~hosted~~ securely
stowed in the mighty buttressed towers of Cloudflare, and utilized
[Astro](https://astro.build/)'s cantrips of static generation, the initial score without any intervention was already decent (80+ on mobile and 90+ on desktop). I layered further enchantments upon my phylactery, including:

- [Preloading fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/rel/preload).
- Enabling certain cloudflare settings for caching [^cf-settings].
- Resizing images and converting to "next-gen" [webp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) format.

The true potency of these enchantments upon my standing in the great Google ledger is murky, but the oracle always demanded sacrifices before a noble conquest.
While this was happening, I noticed that the search results indicated that I
had neglected to update my ~~favicon~~ sigil [^favicon], which
still bore the mundane mark of its Astro lineage. This oversight was swiftly mended.

Fate, the mercurial mistress, had other plans in store. At roughly the same time
of my true branding of the sigil, my banner was abruptly cast from its rightful place
on the first page! This banishment demanded investigation. Had I unknowingly
violated some ancient SEO covenant? My only other action
around the same time was the addition of the [book notes post](/blog/notes-on-writing-to-learn)
which includes an image of the book cover [^self-host]. Despite my best efforts at scrying, I failed to ascertain whether it was the sigil change, the addition of the blasphemous image, or something else entirely that caused this travesty.
Could this graven image have triggered the baleful eye of the copyright sentinels? A perplexing riddle indeed!

Careful reconnaissance of the digital wilds led to a welcome rumour: a cabal of
[turncoats](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) actively working
from within Google's ranks to divulge their secrets! Would they be the key to
uncovering the conspiracy behind this injustice? I sought to find out more.

A series of secret handshakes and esoteric signs [^ownership] later,
they admitted me into their outer ranks and bade me patience, promising a report of their investigations. This turn of events left me anxious to ponder what tidings these findings would portend.

The missives from the cabal arrived not with a thunderclap, but as a quiet trickle of whispers over the ensuing weeks. The scrolls they provided were filled with cryptic charts and arcane metrics, detailing the ebb and flow of supplicants who sought my name. They offered no single key to my triumph, no one ritual that had turned the tide. The impact of my sigil-craft and image-hosting was lost in the chaotic dance of the rankings.

Yet, a pattern emerged. The scrolls showed a distinct shift in fortune that coincided with the creation of a single, unassuming page: the "About Me" page. While that page itself drew few whispers and its own standing remained modest, its mere existence seemed to lend gravitas to the entire phylactery. My home page, the grand entrance to my sanctum, saw its ranking for my name rise significantly in the wake of the "About Me" page's creation.

In hindsight, the logic became clear. My posts were disembodied whispers on the wind, my technical enchantments were spells cast without a focus. The "About Me" page was that focus—the phylactery's very heartstone. It did not need to be the most visited chamber, but it had to exist to give the entire structure a name, a purpose, and an identity. It was the unwavering declaration that anchored all other efforts.

And so, the quest reached its end, albeit with a different understanding. The prophecy was fulfilled not through a single, decisive blow, but by finally giving the herald a true name and face. The phylactery now stands as a recognized landmark in the great Google ledger, its purpose secured. The battle for prominence is a continuous one, but the banner has been planted.

[^strategy]: which doesn't really mean much when you have only a few social accounts and a blog with only a few posts.
[^ownership]: It was a mostly automated process to authorize Google to access
  DNS records on Cloudflare.
[^gh]: Praying, perchance, that House Github would lend its gravitas to my cause.
[^self-host]: self-hosted to avoid hot-linking.
[^prior]: Prior to May 12, 2025.
[^favicon]: The tiny symbol of my phylactery in browser tabs for the non-web developer
  folks reading this.
