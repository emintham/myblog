In the sense of thinking efficiently, with minimal waste; instead of "thinking
like an economist". Is it possible to use strategies and algorithms from
handling "explore vs exploit" trade-off to economize human thinking on a
meta-level? Perhaps I'm doing it backwards-- what I'm after are the ideas that
inspired those algorithms in the first place.
