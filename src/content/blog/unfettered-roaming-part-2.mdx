## Main Text

Yao the Wise offered his throne[^throne] to Xu You, saying: "The sun and moon are both shining, yet the candle flame refuses to go out; to compare its light against them, isn't that too difficult! Timely rain is pouring, yet one is still watering by hand, is that not redundant to the fields? Esteemed master, utopia will be upon us with you on the throne, yet I am still reigning. I feel shameful, please allow me to pass the throne to you."
Xu You: "The world is already at peace under your rule. Would I replace you for the name? The name is secondary to the essence. Would I do it for something secondary? The wren requires but a branch from the forest, and the mole a stomach-full of the stream. Please return sir, for I have no use for the world. Even if the cook doesn't cook, the priest should not overstep and take his place in the kitchen."

Jianwu asks of Lianshu: "I just heard the most fantastic tale from Jieyu. It was bombastic without measure, and exaggerated beyond belief! I am amazed by his words, as vast and infinite as the universe, they were! Such illogical nonsense!"
Lianshu: "What did he say?"
"In the distant Mt. Gushe of legends lived a magical being."

## Analysis

## Original Text

> 堯讓天下於許由，曰：「日月出矣，而爝火不息，其於光也，不亦難乎！時雨降矣，而猶浸灌，其於澤也，不亦勞乎！夫子立，而天下治，而我猶屍之，吾自視缺然。請致天下。」
> 許由曰：「子治天下，天下旣已治也。而我猶代子，吾將為名乎？名者實之賓也。吾將為賓乎？鷦鷯巢於深林，不過一枝；偃鼠飮河，不過滿腹。歸休乎君，予無所用天下為！庖人雖不治庖，尸祝不越樽俎而代之矣。」

> 肩吾問於連叔曰：「吾聞言於接輿，大而無當，往而不返。吾驚怖其言，猶河漢而無極也；大有逕庭，不近人情焉。」
> 連叔曰：「其言謂何哉？」
> 「曰：‘藐姑射之山，有神人居焉，肌膚若冰雪，綽約若處子；不食五“穀，吸風飮露；乘雲氣，御飛龍，而遊乎四海之外。其神凝，使物不疵癘而年穀熟。’吾以是狂而不信也。」
> 連叔曰：「然！瞽者無以與乎文章之觀，聾者無以與乎鐘鼓之聲。豈唯形骸有聾盲哉？夫知亦有之。是其言也，猶時女也。之人也，之德也，將旁礴萬物以為一，世蘄乎亂，孰弊弊焉以天下為事！之人也，物莫之傷，大浸稽天而不溺，大旱金石流、土山焦而不熱。是其塵垢粃穅，將猶陶鑄堯舜者也，孰肯分分然以物為事。”

> 宋人資章甫而適諸越，越人斷髪文身，無所用之。堯治天下之民，平海內之政，往見四子藐姑射之山，汾水之陽，窅然喪其天下焉。

[^throne]: Of the known world.
