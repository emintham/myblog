### Section 2

[Yao the Wise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao) offered his throne[^throne] to Xu You[^xy]: "The sun and moon are out yet the candle burns on. Is it not a difficult contest? The rain pours in a timely manner yet one is still irrigating by hand. Is this not vain effort to the fields? Esteemed master, the world will be well-governed with you on the throne yet why do I occupy this throne still? Please take it."
Xu You: "The world is already well-governed. Would I replace you for the sake of the name? The name is mere guest to reality; would I seek to play the guest? The wren requires but a branch from the forest, and the mole, a bellyful of the stream. Return, my lord. No use have I for the world! Though the chef may not cook, nary should the ritualist leap across the altar vessels to claim his place at the stove."

Jianwu asks of Lianshu[^jwls]: "I heard the most fantastic tale from Jieyu[^jy]. It was bombastic, exaggerated beyond measure! I am horrified by his words-- vast and infinite as the universe, yet illogical nonsense!"
Lianshu: "What did he say?"
"He told me thus: 'In the distant Mt. Gushe of legends lived a magical being whose skin was as snow, gentle as a maiden. She partakes not of the five grains[^fiveg], inhaling only the air and drinking the dew. She rides the winds, herds dragons, and roams beyond the four seas. When she concentrates[^shen], she staves off pestilence and ripens the harvest.' I do not believe a word of his crazy talk!"
Lianshu: "It is so! The blind sees not the beauty of the written word, the deaf hears not the bells and the drums. Are physical senses the only ones that can be veiled? So too can the mind! And these words speak of you! The celestial's virtue merges as one with all of creation. Humans oft embroil themselves in discord; why would she tangle herself in the toils of men? Harm cannot befall a being like her. In floods that submerge the world, she drowns not. In droughts that melt gold and rocks and scorch the mountains, she burn not. Even the merest speck from her suffices to mold wise rulers like Yao and [Shun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun), who would consent to be tethered by the service of things?"

A merchant of Song[^song] went peddling ceremonial hats to the state of Yue, whose inhabitants all wore shaved heads and tattooed their bodies. What use have they for hats? After Yao brought peace to his people under his benevolent rule, he travelled northward across the waters to see the four masters[^four] at Mt. Gushe, upon whence he stood dazed-- his kingdom forgotten.

### Section 2

> 堯讓天下於許由，曰：「日月出矣，而爝火不息，其於光也，不亦難乎！時雨降矣，而猶浸灌，其於澤也，不亦勞乎！夫子立，而天下治，而我猶屍之，吾自視缺然。請致天下。」
> 許由曰：「子治天下，天下旣已治也。而我猶代子，吾將為名乎？名者實之賓也。吾將為賓乎？鷦鷯巢於深林，不過一枝；偃鼠飮河，不過滿腹。歸休乎君，予無所用天下為！庖人雖不治庖，尸祝不越樽俎而代之矣。」

> 肩吾問於連叔曰：「吾聞言於接輿，大而無當，往而不返。吾驚怖其言，猶河漢而無極也；大有逕庭，不近人情焉。」
> 連叔曰：「其言謂何哉？」
> 「曰：‘藐姑射之山，有神人居焉，肌膚若冰雪，綽約若處子；不食五穀，吸風飮露；乘雲氣，御飛龍，而遊乎四海之外。其神凝，使物不疵癘而年穀熟。’吾以是狂而不信也。」
> 連叔曰：「然！瞽者無以與乎文章之觀，聾者無以與乎鐘鼓之聲。豈唯形骸有聾盲哉？夫知亦有之。是其言也，猶時女也。之人也，之德也，將旁礴萬物以為一，世蘄乎亂，孰弊弊焉以天下為事！之人也，物莫之傷，大浸稽天而不溺，大旱金石流、土山焦而不熱。是其塵垢粃穅，將猶陶鑄堯舜者也，孰肯分分然以物為事。”

> 宋人資章甫而適諸越，越人斷髪文身，無所用之。堯治天下之民，平海內之政，往見四子藐姑射之山，汾水之陽，窅然喪其天下焉。

> 惠子謂莊子曰：「魏王貽我大瓠之種，我樹之成而實五石，以盛水漿，其堅不能自舉也；剖之以為瓢，則瓠落無所容。非不呺然大也，吾為其無用而掊之。」
> 莊子曰：「夫子固拙於用大矣。宋人有善為不龜手之藥者，世世以洴澼絖為事。客聞之，請買其方以百金。聚族而謀曰：‘我世世為洴澼絖，不過數金；今一朝而鬻技百金，請與之。’客得之，以說吳王。越有難，吳王使之將，冬與越人水戰，大敗越人，裂地而封之。能不龜手，一也；或以封，或不免於洴澼絖，則所用之異也。今子有五石之瓠，何不慮以為大樽而浮乎江湖，而憂其瓠落無所容？則夫子猶有蓬之心也夫！

> 惠子謂莊子曰：「吾有大樹，人謂之樗。其大本擁腫而不中繩墨，其小枝捲曲而不中規矩，立之塗，匠者不顧。今子之言，大而無用，眾所同去也。」
> 莊子曰：「子獨不見狸狌乎？卑身而伏，以候敖者；東西跳梁，不闢高下；中於機闢，死於罔罟。今夫斄牛，其大若垂天之雲。此能為大矣，而不能執鼠。今子有大樹，患其無用，何不樹之於無何有之鄕，廣莫之野，彷徨乎無為其側，逍遙乎寢臥其下。不夭斤斧，物無害者，無所可用，安所困苦哉！

[^fiveg]: Daoist [practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigu_(grain_avoidance)).
[^throne]: Of the known world.
[^xy]: Legendary hermit. Zhuangzi takes liberties with historical/legendary characters, use them mainly as caricature or archetypes for their occupations and what they seek.
[^jwls]: Both spiritualists of yore.
[^jy]: Refers to a wise hermit of Chu. Zhuangzi uses him as an idealized sage.
[^shen]: Her attention, psychic or otherwise.
[^song]: Another warring state.
