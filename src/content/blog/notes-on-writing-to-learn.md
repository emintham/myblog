I've had this book on my reading list for some time now but never prioritized it
because of the title. While I was interested in both writing and learning,
I never felt an urgent desire to explore "writing to learn" when comparing it to
the other books on my list. However, as I was working on a new post
for the blog, I chanced upon it again and decided to take a detour to read it,
scavenging for fodder for my writing. To my utter surprise, despite the
title, the central thesis and purpose of the book is *not* about writing to learn.
Rather, it is about *writing as thinking/reasoning*, which is a pre-requisite
to learning.

The book presents several excerpts of well-written non-fiction from various
disciplines to underscore Zinsser's points that (1) clear thinking leads to
clear writing, (2) anyone can learn to write well, even if they don't consider
themselves writers or don't have a background in the humanities, and (3) good
writing requires good models/examples. To aid learners on that last point, Zinsser
provided a collection of lucid (and in some cases poetic) writing from various
disciplines, sourced from the experts within those fields. I found the
choice of literature delightful and thoroughly enjoyed reading them even though they were not part of my usual
reading diet. The first point seems intuitively true, but is perhaps a tad difficult
to prove rigorously. The second point is a bit more contentious, I think we can
probably work with a more focused subset of "anyone with enough motivation and/or interest"
and say that it sounds plausible. On the final point, I agree that
good models have improved my writing in discontinuous jumps in the past.
Finally, regarding the central thesis of "writing = thinking/reasoning", that is
the exact topic I was working on. This was a recent realization for me, and I have
been developing the post as a meditation on the topic.

I have been writing for a long time. One of my first memories, ever, is of writing
a short story. It was about a rabbit and a
bomb-- indubitable frontiers of knowledge for a three year old. The exact plot
of the story is lost to time, but I do remember the satisfaction of creating it
ex nihilo.

As I grew older, and was forced to learn Chinese [^chinese-learning],
Chinese composition became a requirement for class and was, unfortunately, not something I was
readily able to transfer my English writing skills to. My mother enrolled me into a Chinese essay writing
class during the period of Grades 3-5 (roughly) and while it helped, I never did
quite achieved the level I wished. At Grade 6, however, worried for my [standardized
exams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School_Achievement_Test_(Malaysia)),
my mother procured a collection of award-winning esssays and stories from
China written by students my age. *That* was eye-opening.

The essays in that collection opened my eyes to what the possibilities could be.
Prior to reading that, I was writing in a
very conventional way, for the lack of a better description. For example, with a prompt of "a day at the beach",
I would describe the events leading to the visit to the beach, the activities at
the beach, and perhaps conclude with a return home-- yawn inducing stuff for both
the reader and the author. The examples
of writing in that collection was different, they were *creative* and broke the
rules. A day at the beach could end up being a musing on ecology, a philosophical
realization, or a heart-warming interaction between family members. My writing
was transformed. I continued to hone my writing along those lines and read even
more voraciously, adding more Chinese books to my book shelf and enriching myself
with writings from different periods in history.

A couple more years later, school required us to write in certain
fixed "formats". For instance, as a letter to a friend, an interview, a formal
letter to a government official, etc. While I did inject wit and creativity into
those and was able to get good grades on them, I was still very much playing by
the rules, within the sandbox circumscribed by the premise of the prompts. It wasn't
until I read《陈鲁豫——心相约》by [Chen Luyu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Luyu),
a prominent Chinese journalist and talk show host, that I realized that *grilling*
someone in an interview could be entertaining and fun. Another "rule" broken yet again.
Interviews became my forte during composition classes from then on. In essence, the interview format allowed
me to introduce *characters* into what was conventionally a dry and informational format.

Given my love of reading (mostly fiction at that point) and writing, I naturally
thought that fiction writing would be something I could do well. I was wrong.
While I applied myself to studying and practicing fiction writing, plotting
was very difficult for me. The early victories did not translate into later successes.
Much belatedly, I had only recently observed that enjoying writing and enjoying fiction
did not necessarily imply that I would be good at writing fiction. I had taken
two facts that were in close proximity and assumed they would do well together [^chocolate-chicken].
As a pivot, I am currently trying my hand at non-fiction writing, something which others
have commented that I do well [^polite]. Even in non-fiction writing, characters, dialogue,
and plot are still important. There are many courses and books for business writing
that expound on the importance of story-telling. As humans, we resonate best
with stories, heroes, underdogs, and everything in between.

My own meandering through the landscapes of composition brought Zinsser's distinctions
about the writing process into sharper focus for me. For instance, he asserts that
there are two types of writing: Type A (explanatory writing) and Type B
(exploratory writing). While not explicitly stated, the implied
idea is that these are distinct and mutually exclusive categories.
I disagree with that assertion, as my personal experience has amply illustrated.
To be more precise, I believe explanatory writing can be written in an exploratory
way. One does not preclude the other. Zinsser seems to conflate the result (the *explanatory* article)
with the process (the *exploratory* writing). Funnily enough, Chapter 12 "World of
Music" covers this exactly.

> “[T]he mystery that lies at the heart of the creative process, not just in music but in writing, painting, sculpture and every other art, as well as in mathematics, the sciences and the humanities. The mathematician, the scientist and the philosopher, thinking and writing their way toward the center of a problem, are no less immersed than the composer, the artist and the writer in an act of commitment that they can never recover or even explain. What finally impels them all is not the work they achieve, but the work of achieving it.”

This beautiful quote from Zinsser himself about the creative process and drive
captures the distinction of process vs result. To me, the process of writing
comes down to a few factors: (1) the default processing mode of the writer, whether
top-down (starting with a clear structure or outline and key points) or bottom-up [^bottoms-up]
(discovering the structure through the process of writing and drafting) [^plan-pants],
and (2) how well the writer knows the topic they are writing about, with the latter being the
more influential factor. The more familiar they are with the topic, the more
likely they are to be able to write it in a top-down, explanatory way. The
information is organized in their mind and they can, relatively speaking, easily present a logical
flow of the information. A likely wrinkle is that an author may be writing
for a different audience than the usual one they are used to, which may require
them to *explore* and explain the information to the new audience in the right way.

Ultimately, this book was a worthwhile read despite the flaws mentioned above.
To me, a good *non-fiction* book is like a Hydra on Mount TBR. Cutting off one head
sprouts more good books from its references. I have already added several
books to my reading list from the references in this book-- books I would probably
never have picked up otherwise.

[^plan-pants]: More commonly known as ["planning" vs "pantsing"](https://blog.nanowrimo.org/post/1308206994/the-great-debate-are-you-a-planner-or-a-pantser) in writing circles.
[^chinese-learning]: A fact I'm ever grateful to my parents for since it allowed me to meet my wife. She wasn't part of the class, but without being able to speak Chinese, I would likely not be able to grow as close to her as I have.
[^chocolate-chicken]: I like chocolate and I like chicken, but chocolate chicken will likely be a disaster in all but the hands of the most skillful of chefs.
[^polite]: Perhaps out of politeness than a sincere compliment, but I will take it nonetheless.
[^bottoms-up]: In contrast to the "bottoms-up" processing method where copious amounts of alchohol is imbibed. A processing mode that I used to employ, to great success I might add, but have since abstained from in recent years.
