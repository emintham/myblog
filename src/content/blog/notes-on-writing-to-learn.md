I've had this book on my reading list for some time now but never prioritized it
because of the title. While I was interested in both writing and learning,
I never felt an urgent desire to explore "writing to learn" when comparing it to
the other books on my list. However, as I was working on a new post
for the blog, I chanced upon it again and decided to take a detour to read it,
scavenging for fodder for my writing. To my utter surprise, despite the
title, the central thesis and purpose of the book is *not* about writing to learn.
Rather, it is about *writing as thinking/reasoning*, which is a pre-requisite
to learning.

The book presents several excerpts of well-written non-fiction from various
disciplines to underscore the author's points that (1) clear thinking leads to
clear writing, and (2) anyone can learn to write well, even if they don't consider
themselves writers or don't have a background in the humanities. I found the
choice of literature delightful and
thoroughly enjoyed reading them even though they were not part of my usual
reading diet. Regarding the central thesis, I am in full agreement as it mirrored
the exact topic I was working on. This was a recent realization for me, and I have
been developing the post as a meditation on the topic.

Zinsser asserts that there are two types of writing: Type A (explanatory
writing) and Type B (exploratory writing). While not explicitly stated, the implied
idea is that these are distinct and mutually exclusive categories.
I disagree with that assertion. Explanatory writing can be written in an exploratory
way. The author seems to conflate the result (the *explanatory* article)
with the process (the *exploratory* writing). Funnily enough, Chapter 12 "World of
Music" covers this exactly.

> “[T]he mystery that lies at the heart of the creative process, not just in music but in writing, painting, sculpture and every other art, as well as in mathematics, the sciences and the humanities. The mathematician, the scientist and the philosopher, thinking and writing their way toward the center of a problem, are no less immersed than the composer, the artist and the writer in an act of commitment that they can never recover or even explain. What finally impels them all is not the work they achieve, but the work of achieving it.”

This beautiful quote from Zinsser himself about the creative process and drive
captures the distinction of process vs result. To me, the process of writing
comes down to a few factors: (1) the default processing mode of the writer, whether
top-down (starting with a clear structure or outline and key points) or bottom-up
(discovering the structure through the process of writing and drafting) [^plan-pants],
and (2) how well the writer knows the topic they are writing about, with the latter being the
more influential factor. The more familiar they are with the topic, the more
likely they are to be able to write it in a top-down, explanatory way. The
information is organized in their mind and they can, relatively speaking, easily present a logical
flow of the information. A likely wrinkle is that the author may be writing
for a different audience than the usual one they are used to, which may require
them to *explore* and explain the information to the new audience in the right way.

[^plan-pants]: More commonly known as ["planning" vs "pantsing"](https://blog.nanowrimo.org/post/1308206994/the-great-debate-are-you-a-planner-or-a-pantser) in writing circles.
