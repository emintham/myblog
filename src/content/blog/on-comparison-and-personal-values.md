Dear Jay,

To compare is human; to compare wisely, freedom. We covet that we do not own and take for granted the ones we do.

Comparison and competition allow us to measure ourselves, in some limited aspect, against reality. This measurement carries an implied standard linked to a value. In any comparison, there is an assumed positive (or desired) property and its inverse. Ranking ourselves among peers through such measurement isn't inherently harmful, it is the uncritical adoption and rigid attachment to the
values underpinning these comparisons that harms us. 

As social animals, living amongst other "comparable" organisms, it is all too
easy to lose sight of your own self and get caught up in the comparison *du jour*, overlooking the hidden values steering the comparison. Upon careful reflection, these might prove to be values you don't truly subscribe to, or worse, values that actively hinder you from achieving your goals.

This tendency to get caught in prevailing comparisons is especially potent when we are young and forging our own sense of self, a time when the values we adopt feel like bedrock, even if they are borrowed and can shift under our feet.

As you grow up and build your identity, it is human nature to want to acquire
and identify with as many "positive" virtues as possible. Indeed, much of growing up is picking and choosing the qualities that resonate most, shaping the story we tell about ourselves, forming the edifice of our identity. During childhood, we adopt or, more accurately, borrow most of our principles from our parents. As teenagers, we absorb some from our peers, often quite unintentionally, and question (or reject) some of our parents' values.

We become more aware of these values upon entering adulthood and start being a bit more mindful of our choices, sometimes picking up our parents' values anew. Moreover, as the social milieu changes, new values are thrust upon you, challenging and sending your early frameworks into obsolescence. This collection of principles, whether borrowed or absorbed, can either be a protective bastion or a tyrannical bastille. 

Do you sometimes feel that the world is pushing you? Obstructing you from achieving your dream? Or, do you have a constant feeling that something
feels wrong or painful— like an ulcer beneath your skin— but you can't quite
articulate what the issue is? Lean into that feeling. Until you reflect, introspect and find out what needs to change, you will never know if it is your assumed values and habits that are imprisoning you.

Adulthood, viewed in this lens, is akin to a game where you play your cards
(values) against reality and other players, evaluating which ones to keep and
which ones to discard— a deck building game of sorts. The challenge, my son, is
that these principles are not just cards in a deck; they are often more like
deep-rooted weeds, or dead trees with roots spread far and wide in the earth of
your identity. Some you planted with care, others sprouted from seeds scattered
by circumstance, their origins perhaps long faded from memory. Convictions,
assumptions, traits, and behaviours that were beneficial or protective during our younger years may cease to serve our growth, becoming encumbrances in adulthood. Identifying too strongly with, and holding too tightly onto, these preconceived notions, cultural scripts, and ideas, creates an inflexible ego, manifesting as mental blockers, limiting your growth and reducing your potential.

Habits, like unwelcome guests, often overstay their welcome, proving far more
stubborn to usher out than they were to let in the door. Whether through the mirror of an external party, or the introspection of your internal light, be honest and do not lie to yourself [^therapy]. Growth and enlightenment follows pain. I will leave you with a quote from 《菜根谭》, “操存要有真宰，无真宰则遇事便倒，何以植顶天立地之砥柱！应用要有圆机，无圆机则触物有碍，何以成旋乾转坤之经纶！”. A literal translation is a bit bombastic so I will skip that and give you a more modern take by Adam Grant— “A mark of wisdom is being quick to change your opinions but slow to change your principles.  It takes openness to update your views. It takes integrity to uphold your values. A key to growth is raising your understanding without lowering your standard”.

There are, however, other benefits to comparison. By comparing ourselves
against the past, we can have a better sense of progress and achievement. We
often look at a mountaintop in the distance, yearning for the prospective elation at scaling its summit, all while losing sight of the fact that we are already on a
significant peak, the journey to which held its own vistas and trials, now
perhaps taken for granted. Care, however, needs to be used in special cases.
Ensconcing one's identity within past victories can be a source of
pain— especially if one is no longer able to perform at the same level. The
pain and disappointment from such a letdown can be very difficult for people
to handle, especially those who used to operate at an elite level [^3].

On the other hand, there are also times when comparison can be used as a means of sharing. Comparing collections from your hobbies for example. Your mother's passion for gardening affords her joy when she can share her collection, trade seeds, compare notes on growing, share her knowledge with her growing buddies. Having such a community in your life to be able to share your hobbies and passion with can alleviate some of the loneliness of trekking your own course. There is a term from Chinese progression fantasy 道友 [^daoyou] that captures this idea of a kindred spirit very well. I hope you'll find your own community in life.

Apart from the effects of comparison on ourselves, we should also consider the
effect of comparison on others. You have a competitive streak, a desire to
outperform others at every turn. Being competitive can be beneficial, it allows you to constantly improve yourself and winning is fun. However, constant reminders of how you are better than others rarely cultivates genuine connection or respect. Many will ingratiate themselves only as long as it benefits them and will abandon you when it appears you no longer serve their purposes.

People generally do not want to be or feel "lesser" than others— even for values
they don’t agree with. For example, most people will likely not think height is a
property worth comparing and ascribing personal worth against. Yet, a simple neutral remark that you are taller than they are could germinate a grudge and make life difficult for you in some form, unbeknownst to you, at some future date. Even close friends and family, constantly subjected to these unsolicited comparisons, will their goodwill eroded and not want to spend as much time with you. You do not need to "win" any competition to prove yourself or elevate your worth in others' eyes. Or, as Zeng Guofan [^zgf] put it, “ 好胜人者，必无胜人之处，能胜人，自不居胜” (trans: Those who are eager to defeat others will inevitably have no genuine advantage. A truly superior individual does not dwell on their victories). 

Live your life according to your own compass. Strive for self-improvement driven
by your own aspirations, not by a desire to appear superior, wealthier, or
smarter in the eyes of others. Other people care much less about you than you
think— don’t let their thoughts and judgements be the rudder of your ship.
Overcoming yourself is the virtuous cycle that feeds your strength and
confidence, not the awe and admiration of others. When you focus on yourself,
and not at the expense of others, you will get better; awe and envy will just
be a side-effect. Confucius said "己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人" (translation:
If you want to establish yourself, help others to establish themselves; if you
want to succeed, help others to succeed.) I have found this to be true in my
personal and professional life.

There is another subtle arena of comparison: the urge to correct others. You have a tendency for accuracy— and that’s great! Much of people’s daily conversations are ambiguous and we should strive for accuracy whenever we can. However, people misspeak. You can politely and gently point them to the right information in private. Alternatively, they could be intentionally trying to
spread misinformation or sway a narrative; in this case, you'll probably want
to weigh the impact of this misinformation on the audience against offending
this person. Is it worth the risk to you (and the people you care about) [^selfish] to point this out? With your ADHD, I understand far too well your impulse to correct it for I have had similar social faux pas in my youth. The correction springs to mind, and the impulse to voice it can be immediate, often bypassing any conscious consideration. I’ve had many sleepless nights, regretting these past mindless mistakes. Again, mindfulness will help here. Not all idioms and
sayings are wise in every situation but in these cases, "praise in public,
criticize in private", and in the latter, do so sparingly. I share here
with you an interesting excerpt from the excellent [Autobiography of Benjamin
Franklin](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20203/20203-h/20203-h.htm) [^5] that illustrates this point. Franklin’s transformation, from a
"positive arguer" to a "humble inquirer" is a testament to the strength found
in intellectual modesty and the art of gentle persuasiveness [^6].

> (Regarding the Socratic method) I found this method safest for myself and very embarrassing to those against whom I used it; therefore I took a delight in it, practis'd it continually, and grew very artful and expert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into concessions, the consequences of which they did not foresee, entangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate themselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my cause always deserved. I continu'd this method some few years, but gradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced anything that may possibly be disputed, the words certainly, undoubtedly, or any others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me, or I should think it so or so, for such and such reasons; or I imagine it to be so; or it is so, if I am not mistaken. This habit, I believe, has been of great advantage to me when I have had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and persuade men into measures that I have been from time to time engaged in promoting; and, as the chief ends of conversation are to inform or to be informed, to please or to persuade, I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat everyone of those purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure. For, if you would inform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention. If you wish information and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet at the same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in your present opinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, will probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error. And by such a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in pleasing your hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire. 

As with most things, it would be remiss of me if I did not caution you against
going to the extreme. It is beneficial and advantageous in many cases to market
and promote yourself. Care and judgement must be taken to not overdo it or
diminish the contributions of others. In life, only you can be your best
advocate. If you create the most innovative invention in the world but no one
knows about it, it is not useful to anyone [^7]. Practically speaking, talking
about your accomplishments or creations in a matter-of-fact way or framing it
as a net benefit to others is more palatable. You can also very gently remind
others of how you helped them by framing it as a follow-up question. "Hey,
just wanted to check in to see how you were doing with X? Did it help you? Did
you have any questions or concerns about it?". People can and do forget the
help they've received, not usually from malice, but because their own concerns
and priorities are naturally foremost in their minds. While it can be magnanimous to simply treat help rendered as charity, it is not the wisest course of action when working in a group. Your energy and resources are limited; being able to leverage those favours and have it translate to tangible benefits will likely benefit everyone in the long run [^8]. Give freely, but make sure they remember— and without being a jerk about it.

[^selfish]: Sometimes, the right answer is to do what you believe in strongly
        and not care too much about what your loved ones think. Far too often,
        we make decisions based on what we *think* our loved ones want
        instead of what they actually want or what *we* want. Identifying your
        core principles and convictions will help you make the choice that
        you can live with, even if it may cause the ire of your loved ones.

[^therapy]: Therapy is widely regarded as the most recommended way of shedding mental and behavioural habits in modern times. While therapy (with the right therapist) excels at unearthing deeply rooted mental shortcuts, early adoption of mindfulness, self-awareness, and meditation can help you identify and uproot these habits before they take hold. Moreover, they do not require an external party to help you and require no lengthy search process for the right fit.
