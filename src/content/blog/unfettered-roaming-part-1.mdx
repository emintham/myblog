## Preface

Unfettered Roaming (*xiaoyao you*, 逍遙遊) is the first essay of the Inner Chapters and presents central themes of Zhuangzi's philosophy. It exposes the artificiality of differentiation, considers name and status meaningless, and questions human utility-- arguing that these limit human potential and are the root of disorder. In essence, it establishes the ideal state of consciousness -- liberation or *xiaoyao* 逍遙 -- as an antidote for restoring balance.

It is worth noting that Zhuangzi does not explicitly label this state of consciousness analytically anywhere within the text[^xy]; rather, for reasons that will become clearer in Chapter 2, he uses the sage as an archetype possessing this consciousness. Zhuangzi's liberation transcends being free and unburdened and includes the insight of emptiness-- the lack of inherent, independent existence[^future]. Once this foundational condition is realized, the other themes follow as natural corollaries.

The essay itself can roughly be treated as three sections and we will cover the first of these in this post.

## Main Text

> In the northern sea dwelt a fish named "Kun"[^kun], vast beyond measure, who transformed into a bird named "Peng". When Peng beat its wings and took flight, they mantled the sky like clouds hanging on heaven's edge. Riding the sea winds, this great bird journeyed to the southern sea-- that celestial pool.

> The book of marvels, *Qi Xie*, records: "As Peng migrates south, the waves rise as high as three thousand *li*[^li]. It mounts the cyclone up ninety thousand *li*, on the winds of the sixth month". The shifting air, the dust, and living things are all blown about by the winds. Is blue the true colour of the sky? Or is it merely because the sky is far and has no edges? When it looks down, perhaps the view is much the same.

> Shallow waters cannot float a large boat. Water from a cup poured into a hollow floats small grass, but the cup itself, placed within, will run aground, for the water is shallow and the boat large. Feeble winds cannot lift large wings. Thus, to rise ninety thousand *li*, the winds must buoy Peng so that it may carry the skies without obstacles on its southward trip.

> The cicada laughs to the pigeon: "I strive only to reach the boughs of the elm and the Fang trees; sometimes I can't even reach those and have to be satisfied on the ground. Why fly south ninety thousand *li*[^cicada]?"

> Those making a roundtrip to the plains need only three meals; those traveling a hundred *li* need food enough for an overnight; those traveling a thousand *li* require three months' worth. How little these two creatures understand!

> A small knowledge is inferior to a large wisdom, and short lives do not compare to long lives. How can we know this? The fungi, born in the morning and withered before dusk, know not how the night turns to day; the cicada, born during spring and dead by summer, knows not of a "year"-- this is the short-lived. In the south of Chu[^chu] lives a mythical turtle, for whom 500 years is but a season; in ancient times, there was a great tree, Chun, its seasons 8000 years apiece-- this is the long-lived. Ancestor Peng is known to this day for his longevity; is it not pitiful for us to compare ourselves to him?

> Similarly, consider the following from *Liezi*'s Tang Dialectics.
Tang inquired of Ji thus: "Do up, down, and the four cardinal directions admit of limit?"
Ji answered: "Beyond the infinite is yet more infinite. In the barrens of the extreme north, there is a sea-- a celestial pool. In it is a fish thousands of *li* wide and of unknown length. Its name is Kun. There is also a bird named Peng, its back as large as Mt. Tai and its wings as wide as the clouds at the edge of the sky. It lifts itself ninety thousand *li* on a ram's horn, beyond the clouds, its back against the azure skies and flies south. The sparrow by a small pond laughs: 'Where is it headed? I hop and flit, reaching only a few *ren*[^ren], flying among the reeds. That is the limit of flight. Where does Peng think it's going?'". This is the difference between the small and the large.

> Thus, those with intellect sufficient for a government position can align their behaviour to a village's needs; and, if their values match the ruler's, they acquire the trust to govern the state. Song Rongzi would have given them a placid smile, just like he does with the sparrows. Neither spurred when the entire world lauds him nor disappointed when criticized by all, Song Rongzi has distinguished the self from the external, thereby casting away both pride and shame. But that's his limit! He does not toil for status in this bustling world, yet there is more he has not achieved. Legend has it that Liezi can glide on the winds with such lightness for fifteen days before returning. He, too, pursues bliss with grace. Although he is able to get around without walking, he still has that upon which he depends.

> If one can align oneself with the natural flow, master the transitions between the six states[^states], and, thence, roam in the realm of the infinite, what else would one depend upon? Thus, it is said that: the achieved one has no self, the spiritual no merit, the sage no name.

## Analysis

I'm not sure about you but I was definitely awed (and also somewhat bewildered) when I first encountered the passage above. What is he trying to teach us? The narrative flits between topics with only a vague through-line, tantalizing the reader with an enlightenment that  seems a hair out of reach. The secret, perhaps, is to read this from the last paragraph-- conveniently placed right above this. Zhuangzi tells us that there are three "levels"[^levels] to liberation: indifference to opinion, mastery of nature, and finally, absolute non-dependence. To achieve that, one must align with the flow. See, that wasn't too hard was it? Now let's dive  deeper and interrogate the other points that were introduced.

Zhuangzi begins the narration with the majestic[^comic] flight of Kun/Peng. Far from being pure mythology, it beautifully encapsulates several themes of Zhuangzi's philosophy in a story. First, Zhuangzi specifically "names" the beast in the story twice. Once, as "Kun" -- playfully using an archaic term for fish roe -- and, again, as "Peng" when it transforms into a bird. This deliberate choice highlights the arbitrariness and limitations of labels. Are the fish and the bird truly different beings or is this distinction merely a product of our limited perspective imposing artificial boundaries on the essence of things? Furthermore, this transformation from fish to bird suggests that our nature is not static. The potential to shift from the submerged, heavy existence of Kun to the soaring perspective of Peng exists within the same being; we are processes, not fixed entities.

Next, consider the wind imagery -- a constant metaphor throughout Daoist text -- an embodiment of both the principle of non-forcing action (*wu wei*, 無為) and the Dao. The migration and the ascent of Peng is attributed directly to the "winds" of the sixth month-- typical monsoon season. Peng's flight is not due to any intrinsic ability or heroic struggle but, rather, effortless coordination with natural forces-- it simply rides what is already there. Rising high, what conventional thinking might celebrate as Peng's achievement, is revealed to be less about personal merit than about alignment with natural forces. All is moved by the wind/Dao.

Zhuangzi then circles back to his earlier point on the essence of things, raising an epistemological question about the colour of the sky. Is colour an intrinsic quality or the reflections of an extrinsic force? Finally, note the ambiguous *it* in the last paragraph where the subject is left unclear. While most translators interpret it to be Peng, I have decided to preserve the ambiguity. Could this refer to the sky/Dao looking down? By leaving this open, Zhuangzi invites us to shift perspectives. He is not arguing that the bird's view is "true" and the cicada's "false"; rather, he illustrates that all views are relative (or as philosophers say, *indexical*)-- bound by the position of the observer. Our categories and judgments often reveal more about our own limited viewpoint and position than about the true nature of things.

Having established this cosmic vision through myth, Zhuangzi now turns to logical argumentation, deliberately stepping away from romanticism to make his point of small (individual effort) vs large (Dao-aligned) explicit. This is argued through the lens of *capacity*-- a small vessel necessarily contains lesser than a larger one. Zhuangzi expands this further to foreshadow the concept of dependence -- the foundational determinant of liberation he returns to later -- and the necessity of accumulation (*ji*, 積). He notes that shallow water cannot float a large boat; likewise, thin air cannot support great wings. This adds a crucial nuance to the idea of "going with the flow": one requires sufficient depth -- of character, of understanding, of *qi* -- to ride the great Dao. Without this accumulation, one is like the cup in the hollow-- grounded by the very reality one hopes to navigate. Just as Peng awaits the right moment to transform and ride the cyclone, travellers need to furnish themselves with the right amount of rations before their journey. Preparation, however, is only possible when one expands one's perspective and is open to what lies ahead-- highlighting, once again, the limits one's understanding circumscribes.

Looking at it differently, recall that there are three instances of laughter or smiling: the cicada, the sparrow, and Song Rongzi. The cicada and the sparrow represent *parochial arrogance*; limited by their lifespans and intellect, they find the migration incomprehensible and impossible. Song Rongzi, meanwhile, represents *spiritual complacency*. He has risen above the noise of society, yet he remains content in his own bubble of moral self-sufficiency, failing to see the infinite horizon beyond. He has accumulated enough "depth" to float above the noise of society, but not enough to ride the wind of the infinite. Even the magical Liezi, who has mastered flight, has not reached the peak of Zhuangzian liberation, for he still seeks bliss and has not fully become non-dependent. Zhuangzi concludes the section by re-iterating his thesis of going with the flow and expanding one's mind; leaving us with the three stages.

Taken together, these elements paint a vision of infinite potential available to those who shed their mental bondage-- the fixed identities, rigid categories, conventional expectations, and ambitions that bind us. We empathize with the struggle of the underdog, root for the hero who gets up against all odds; but that is perhaps why those stories are so captivating-- a fantasy, a useful fiction we tell ourselves so that we may continue this Sisyphean life. The alternative is not, however, nihilism-- it is to act in alignment with the natural currents of existence. Paradoxically, it is by surrendering to the flow that one first finds capability, and finally, liberation.

## Original Text

> 北冥有魚，其名為鯤。鯤之大，不知其幾千里也。化而為鳥，其名為鵬。鵬之背，不知其幾千里也；怒而飛，其翼若垂天之雲 。是鳥也，海運則將徙於南冥。南冥者，天池也。

> 《齊諧》者，志怪者也。《諧》之言曰：「鵬之徙於南冥也，水擊三千里，搏扶搖而上者九萬裡。去以六月息者也。」野馬也，塵埃也，生物之以息相吹也。天之蒼蒼，其正色邪？其遠而無所至極邪？其視下也，亦若是則已矣。

> 且夫水之積也不厚，則其負大舟也無力。覆杯水於坳堂之上，則芥為之舟；置杯焉則膠，水淺而舟大也。風之積也不厚，則其負大翼也無力。故九萬裡，則風斯在下矣，而後乃今培風；背負靑天而莫之夭閼者，而後乃今將圖南。

> 蜩與學鳩笑之曰：「我決起而飛，搶楡枋，時則不至而控於地而已矣，奚以之九萬裡而南為？」

> 適莽蒼者，三飡而反，腹猶果然；適百里者，宿舂糧；適千里者，三月聚糧。之二蟲又何知！

> 小知不及大知，小年不及大年。奚以知其然也？朝菌不知晦朔，蟪蛄不知春秋，此小年也。楚之南有冥靈者，以五百歲為春，五百歲為秋；上古有大椿者，以八千歲為春，八千歲為秋，此大年也 。而彭祖乃今以久特聞，眾人匹之，不亦悲乎！

> 湯之問棘也是已：
湯問棘曰：「上下四方有極乎？」
棘曰：「無極之外，復無極也。窮髪之北有冥海者，天池也。有魚焉，其廣數千里，未有知其修 者，其名為鯤。有鳥焉，其名為鵬，背若太山，翼若垂天之雲，搏扶搖羊角而上者九萬裡，絕雲氣，負靑天，然後圖南，〔且適南冥也〕。斥鴳笑之曰：‘彼且奚適也？我騰躍而上，不過數仭而下，翱翔蓬蒿之間，此亦飛之至也。而彼且奚適也？’」此小大之辯也。

> 故夫知效一官，行比一鄕，德合一君而徵一國者，其自視也亦若此矣。而宋榮子猶然笑之。且舉世而譽之而不加勸，舉世而非之而不加沮，定乎內外之分，辯乎榮辱之境，斯已矣。彼其於世未數數然 也。雖然，猶有未樹也。夫列子御風而行，泠然善也，旬有五日而後反。彼於致福者，未數數然也。此雖免乎行，猶有所待者也。

> 若夫乘天地之正，而御六氣之辯，以遊無窮者，彼且惡乎待哉！故曰，至人無己，神人無功，聖人無名。

[^xy]: Using it only in the colloquial sense of free and unburdened at the end of section 3.
[^future]: A concept that resonates with [the perfection of wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajnaparamita) in Buddhism and finds echoes in Thoreau's [work](https://amzn.to/4pcc3cu). Like happy families, enlightened ones are perhaps all alike.
[^li]: [Chinese mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_(unit)), approx 405m.
[^cicada]: Alternative reading is "How is it possible that one could".
[^chu]: One of the seven warring states.
[^ren]: Seven "feet" in Zhou dynasty units.
[^kun]: Archaic term for fish roe.
[^states]: Yin, Yang, Wind, Rain, Dark, and Light.
[^rh]: Cyclone.
[^comic]: Or, comic -- an equally valid, and perhaps even intended, view -- if you parse it as follows: "In the northern sea was a fish named FishEgg. He was large, very large. One day, he decided he wanted to be a bird instead. And, lo! he was now a big bird!"
[^levels]: One might argue that these levels imply a *judgement* about what is better in absolute terms but I would caution that this is a trap. Take it as a description of what is without internalizing the judgement-- just as accepting that 100 is less than 101 without owning the feeling that one's 100 is somehow *lesser*. For a Buddhist perspective, consider [Chapter 9 of the Diamond Sutra](https://diamond-sutra.com/read-the-diamond-sutra-here/diamond-sutra-chapter-9/). Alternatively, certain scholars treat these three as different names for the sage. Since a sage necessarily possesses all three of these qualities, it's not an important distinction to make.
